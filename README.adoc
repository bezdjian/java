== Test containers with Spring boot

Prerequisites:
- AWS credentials file (will not actually use the credentials)
- Mongodb service/driver on the machine

=== Run locally
`mvn spring-boot:test-run`

This will run the Application.java under the test folder with Test Containers for local development

=== Run 'prod'
`mvn spring-boot:run`

This will target local machines MongoDB and real AWS endpoint

Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

=== Run integration tests with test containers
`mvn test -Pintegration-tests`

=== Run cucumber tests with test containers
`mvn test -Pcucumber-tests`

=== Run unit tests
`mvn test -Punit-tests`

=== Run all tests
`mvn test`

=== Run with docker-compose
`docker compose build`

`docker compose up`

This will use spring profile 'docker' with application-docker.yml file
